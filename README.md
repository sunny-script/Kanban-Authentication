# Kanban Board with JWT Authentication

## üìå Project Overview
This project enhances an existing Kanban board application by adding secure authentication using **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**. Users can securely log in, manage their tasks, and experience session management with token-based authentication.

### üåü Key Features
- **Secure Login Page**: Username and password authentication with JWT.
- **Session Management**:
  - Tokens are stored securely in local storage for subsequent authenticated requests.
  - Automatic logout after session expiration.
- **Error Handling**: Informative error messages for invalid credentials.
- **Protected Routes**: Access to the Kanban board is restricted to authenticated users.
- **Responsive Deployment**: Fully deployed and operational on Render.

## üßë‚Äçüíª User Story

**AS A** member of an agile team,  
**I WANT** a Kanban board with a secure login page,  
**SO THAT** I can securely access and manage my work tasks.

---

## ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria

- **GIVEN** a Kanban board with a secure login page:
  - **WHEN** I load the login page  
    **THEN** I am presented with form inputs for username and password.
  - **WHEN** I enter valid credentials  
    **THEN** I am authenticated using JWT and redirected to the main Kanban board page.
  - **WHEN** I enter invalid credentials  
    **THEN** I am presented with an error message indicating that the credentials are incorrect.
  - **WHEN** I successfully log in  
    **THEN** a JWT is securely stored in local storage for authenticated requests.
  - **WHEN** I log out  
    **THEN** the JWT is removed from local storage, and I am redirected to the login page.
  - **WHEN** I access the Kanban board without authentication  
    **THEN** I am redirected to the login page.
  - **WHEN** I remain inactive for a defined period  
    **THEN** my session expires, the JWT is invalidated, and I am redirected to the login page.

## üß™ Testing Instructions

### Valid Login:
- Enter valid credentials and verify redirection to the Kanban board.
- Check that the JWT is stored in local storage.

### Invalid Login:
- Enter incorrect credentials and verify that an error message is displayed.

### Protected Routes:
- Attempt to access the Kanban board without logging in and ensure you are redirected to the login page.

### Session Expiration:
- Remain inactive for the defined period and verify that the session expires, logging you out automatically.
